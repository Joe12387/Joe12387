I am available for hire.

I have over 10 years experience in CompSec and web development.

I don't have a degree. If that bothers you, do not contact me.

I work remotely and will not accept any other position regardless of salary.

I will not accept anything less than $60k/yr.

If you are a recruiter and offer me anything that does not jive with the above sentences, I will ignore you.
