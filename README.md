I'm a software developer specializing in information security, reverse engineering, browser fingerprinting & bot detection.

I maintain several open source repositories here on GitHub.

You can contact me at Joe@dreggle.com. My PGP key is available [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=Joe%40dreggle.com) if you for some reason require increased confidentiality.

That's about it.
