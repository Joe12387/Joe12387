I'm a software developer specializing in information security, reverse engineering, browser fingerprinting & bot detection.

I maintain several open source repositories here on GitHub.

You can contact me at Joe@dreggle.com. My PGP key is available [here](https://keys.openpgp.org/search?q=Joe%40dreggle.com) if for some reason you require increased confidentiality.

That's about it.

Here are my current active projects as of September 2024:

- [OverpoweredJS](https://overpoweredjs.com/) - OverpoweredJS is a replacement of the deprecated [OPFS](https://github.com/Joe12387/OP-Fingerprinting-Script) browser fingerprinting library. It features an API designed to be able to track Chromium browser instances with incredible accuracy and uniqueness. Feel free to contact me if you're interested in a particular use case of browser fingerprinting and I may be able to work on a solution for you.
- [detectIncognito](https://github.com/Joe12387/detectIncognito) - A TypeScript/JavaScript library for detecting the use of incognito mode or a similar private browsing mode when a browser visits a site. Works with all browsers with compatability for old browsers going back approximately 10 years.
- [Browser Fingerprinting Resistance Research](https://github.com/Joe12387/browser-fingerprinting-resistance-research) - Documentation on the current state of browser fingerprinting, browsers' attempts at mitigating such techniques, and the current traceability of all browsers (hint: it's almost all of them).
